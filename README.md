I got extremely salty because I was on Opera GX, right? Right. And I happen to think about the background music, so I went to look up "Mice On Venus," because how can you go wrong with Minecraft?
So, I did, and I was disappointed when I saw only 1 mod that was the Mice On Venus song as background music, and it wasn't even the version I wanted - It was the newer, remastered version.
I decided to make an Opera GX mod, but I didn't think it would include using GitHub - A website I've never seen, touched, or used. I've only heard of it.
So I am completely new here and I will nonchalantly mess everything up accidentally with zero remorse. I used Python before, sure it was only for what? Like, 2 months? But I still used it.
